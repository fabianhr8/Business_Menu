BUSIENESS_MENU

GUI developed in Python3. Tested in Linux Mint 18.2 and Windows 10.

It is a work in progress, part of a Business Management desktop application I've been working on.

The code has 2 clients and 2 different products, but it works the same way if more cilents and products are added.
First, one of the 2 clients is chosen, then the item menu appears, as well as a frame that shows that client's 
order with the items bought on that account and the quantity of each item.

I am working on the "Total" money owed by that client and the "Pay" button that should reset the client's list for
the next client while saving the info of that payed account on another file for later reference.
