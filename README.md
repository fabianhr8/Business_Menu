# Business_Menu
Manages client's orders and the items on a business inventory, also saves a daily log for future reference.

GUI developed in Python3. 
Tested in Linux Mint 18.2 and Windows 10.

It is a work in progress, part of a Business Management desktop application I've been working on.

The code has 2 clients and 2 different products, but it works the same way if more cilents and products are added.
Steps:
1. One of the 2 clients is chosen and you have the chance to change the client's name or to leave it as is.
2. The item menu appears, as well as a frame that shows the actual client's order. In this order there's the items ordered, the quantity for each item and the total bill.
3. There are 2 example item's buttons, you can add them in any quantity to the actual client's account. You can also change between clients.
4. There is a "pay" button. When it is clicked the client's account details will be saved to a CSV with a daily log and the account will be restored to its original settings.
